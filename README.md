### What is Category Punting

"Punting a category means that a fantasy manager intentionally chooses to not focus on a specific category during their draft. The reasoning behind this is you can strengthen your team in the categories that you are not punting."

### Punting Strategy Tool

This new tool affords the knowledge needed to optimize draft strategy and settings.

### How it works

The Punting Strategy Tool ingests:

    League Settings,
    Player Projections,
    Projected Draft Values, and
    outputs all category combinations with a Punting Strategy Score.

### Logic

The needed logic expands on the Fantasy Baseball Salary Cap Calculator:
https://draftwizard.fantasypros.com/editor/createFromProjections.jsp?auction=Y&sport=mlb

    Punting Strategy (PS) is created from all category combinations.
    Projected Draft Value (PDV) is subtracted from Player Value (PV) to arrive at Player Alpha (PA).
    Player Alpha (PA) is summed by Punting Strategy (PS) to create the Punting Strategy Score (PSS).

### Result

### Demo

I created a demo to test my logic using MySQL.
This demo calculated for

    hitters,
    10 teams,
    8 positions, and
    limited players to one eligible position.

The MySQL dump is available here: https://github.com/stavo-dev/punting-strategy/blob/main/db_punting_strategy.sql

Iâ€™m happy to provide additional MySQL code and formulas upon request.
