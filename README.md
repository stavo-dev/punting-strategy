### What is Category Punting

"Punting a category means that a fantasy manager intentionally chooses to not focus on a specific category during their draft. The reasoning behind this is you can strengthen your team in the categories that you are not punting."

### Punting Strategy Tool

This new tool affords the knowledge needed to optimize Fantasy Basbeall draft strategy and settings.

### How it works

The Punting Strategy Tool ingests:

* League Settings,
* Player Projections,
* Projected Draft Values, and
* outputs all category combinations with a Punting Strategy Score.

### Logic

The needed logic expands on the Fantasy Baseball Salary Cap Calculator: https://draftwizard.fantasypros.com/editor/createFromProjections.jsp?auction=Y&sport=mlb

* Punting Strategy (PS) is created from all category combinations.
* Projected Draft Value (PDV) is subtracted from Player Value (PV) to arrive at Player Alpha (PA).
* Player Alpha (PA) is summed by Punting Strategy (PS) to create the Punting Strategy Score (PSS).

### Demo

I created this basic demo to test my logic using MySQL. This demo calculated for:

* hitters,
* 10 teams,
* 8 positions, and
* limited players to one eligible position.

The MySQL dump is available here: https://github.com/stavo-dev/punting-strategy/blob/main/db_punting_strategy.sql

Iâ€™m happy to provide additional MySQL code and formulas upon request.
